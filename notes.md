# My notes on "Bookmark Analyzer" project - Ryan Jackson
*I should have a better name or code name, for this project (and not Markalyzer5000).*

Given the amount of projects added to this solution, but none of them are working all that well,  
I know it seems like I am trying to do too much at once, but more or less,  
I'm "thinking out loud", and having fun doing it.

On the Firefox sync server, I'm adding it because the code is already written and open source.  
Including it is a usability win, and I wish Google provided the same thing (in an open source way) for Chrome.  
Currently, I'm aiming on building and running the code locally via Python, so I know it works properly (a good practice),  
then porting the code to IronPython (shouldn't be a big issue, as my understanding is that IronPython works with Python 2, and that most packages interoperate well).
